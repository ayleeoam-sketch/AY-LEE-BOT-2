/*
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  BUILT-IN KEYS  —  the only file you ever have to edit
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Paste your keys between the quotes below and they ship WITH the code.
 * Anyone who clones, forks or redeploys this bot gets a fully working
 * install with no .env, no signups and no "where do I get an API key?".
 *
 * Precedence, highest first:
 *   1. .env  /  panel environment variables   (a deployer's own key wins)
 *   2. .setkey from WhatsApp                  (stored in MongoDB)
 *   3. these built-in values                  (the safety net)
 *
 * ⚠️  Anything here is PUBLIC once the repo is public. Only put keys in
 *     that you are happy for strangers to burn through. Free-tier keys
 *     (Groq, Gemini, Pexels, Pixabay) are the right kind to share; keys
 *     tied to a credit card (OpenAI, DeepSeek) are NOT — leave those blank
 *     and let deployers add their own.
 *
 * Rate limits are per key, so a shared key is shared quota. If .ai starts
 * getting slow for everyone, add a second provider below — the bot fails
 * over down the chain automatically.
